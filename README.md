# Are you down with OPP?
**Open Permit Process** was born out of the [Open Twin Cities Geo:Code 2.0 Event](http://opentwincities.coeventer.com/events/16-geo-code-2016) over the weekend of March 5th/6th, 2016.

### Concept/Vision
Leverage public data, free tools and creative techniques for providing an improved permitting experience for both the users as well as the permitting agencies/departments.

### Initial Focus
We wanted to focus on the user's work flow for finding and submitting a permit. We also wanted to create a process that required less paper and would allow complete applications to be submitted electronically.

### Problems Being Solved
* Discovery is difficult at best and Impossible at worst.
* Permits almost always require printing and hand delivery to a physical location.
* Any maps that must accompany a permit must be provided by the person submitting the permit. This is often a hand drawn map.
* Inconsistency is the standard within a City/County/State and there is a lack of framework for scaling a enterprise-level solution that could be shared between cities, counties and even at the state level.

#### Additional Problems Identified
* Payment turn-around is very slow. Bills can take many months to arrive after a permit is submitted and approved
* Feedback to the user about the status of the permit (Approved, rejected, other)
* Signatures for approval of permit where necessary
* Associated Permits may or may not be referenced if even listed as an option
