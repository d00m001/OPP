{"name": "OPP","tagline": "Using Open Source GIS and Web Technologies to Improve the Permit Process for Government","body": "# Are you down with OPP?\r\n**Open Permit Process** was born out of the [Open Twin Cities Geo:Code 2.0 Event](http://opentwincities.coeventer.com/events/16-geo-code-2016) over the weekend of March 5th/6th, 2016.\r\n\r\n### Concept/Vision\r\nLeverage public data, free tools and creative techniques for providing an improved permitting experience for both the users as well as the permitting agencies/departments.\r\n\r\n### Initial Focus\r\nWe wanted to focus on the user's work flow for finding and submitting a permit. We also wanted to create a process that required less paper and would allow complete applications to be submitted electronically.\r\n\r\n### Problems Being Solved\r\n* Discovery is difficult at best and Impossible at worst.\r\n* Permits almost always require printing and hand delivery to a physical location.\r\n* Any maps that must accompany a permit must be provided by the person submitting the permit. This is often a hand drawn map.\r\n* Inconsistency is the standard within a City/County/State and there is a lack of framework for scaling a enterprise-level solution that could be shared between cities, counties and even at the state level.\r\n\r\n#### Additional Problems Identified\r\n* Payment turn-around is very slow. Bills can take many months to arrive after a permit is submitted and approved\r\n* Feedback to the user about the status of the permit (Approved, rejected, other)\r\n* Signatures for approval of permit where necessary\r\n* Associated Permits may or may not be referenced if even listed as an option\r\n\r\n####Geo:Code 2.0 Slack Presentation\r\n[OPP](http://opentwincities.coeventer.com/projects/131-easy-to-use-permitting-application/presentation)\r\n\r\n####Free Hosting for Interwebs Testing on AppHarbor\r\n[OPP on the Interwebs](http://opp.apphb.com/)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Developer :: Donn O'Malley \r\n  * @donnomalley\r\n  * @d00m001\r\n  * [Resume](http://donnomalley.omalleyland.com)\r\n* Developer :: Jim Bystrom \r\n  * [Open TC Profile](http://opentwincities.coeventer.com/users/392)\r\n\r\nHonorable Mentions:\r\n* Cory Yemen\r\n* Jessie Roushar\r\n* Betsy Culpepper\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nTBD\r\n","google": "","note": "Don't delete this file!
